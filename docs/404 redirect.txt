Steps to set custom page for page not found error(404)
1. Open /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file
Add this line: ErrorDocument 404 /path_to_file_where_you_want_to_redirect (this file path will be relative to the doc root)
2. In this file set header location of another file if you want to redirect

For ex.
in httpd.conf:
ErrorDocument 404 /index.php

in index.php:
header('Location: workdir/index.php');
